## How do I file production support incidents or get help? 

All production incident support tickets for Azure Cloud HSM should be submitted through the Azure Portal under Help+Support. 

The Azure Cloud HSM SDK uses GitHub issues solely for tracking bugs and feature requests specific to the SDK. It does not handle production live site support incidents. To avoid duplicates, please search existing issues before creating a new one. For new issues, submit your bug report or feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about onboarding to Azure Cloud HSM or the Azure Cloud HSM SDK, please contact your Microsoft Account Manager. If you do not have an assigned Account Manager, please contact Microsoft Support.
